# algorithm
The purpose of this project is merely for studying and praticing some algorithm (initially from the excellent book - Cracking the coding interview - and maybe later from another sources)

Informal "disclaimer": don't use this code in a real world problem as some of them are my thoughts about how to approach some problem, e.g. I am not even following a correct Java naming convention for the classes - you definitely should not take for granted that all codes here are running well. ;)
